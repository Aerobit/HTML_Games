# Fun Games Collection

Welcome to the **Fun Games Collection**! This repository hosts a growing collection of browser-based games, each one designed for a fun and interactive experience right in your browser. Whether you're looking to pass the time or challenge yourself, these games are perfect for you.

## Available Games

### 1. Hangman Game
The classic word-guessing game where you must guess the hidden word one letter at a time. With each wrong guess, another part of the hangman is drawn. Too many incorrect guesses, and it's game over!

- **Features**:
  - Multiple categories of words, including simple ones for beginners and challenging ones for pros.
  - Cool animations to celebrate wins or signal losses.
  - Cheat button (with cooldown) for when you're stuck.
  - Streak and scoring system to track your performance.

- **Memory Match**: Flip and match pairs of cards while trying to remember their locations.
